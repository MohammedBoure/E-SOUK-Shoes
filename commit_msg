feat(order): generate UUID on client-side and send with order insert

- Orders are now assigned UUIDs in the browser using crypto.randomUUID()
- Ensures that users cannot access or guess others' order IDs
- Removed .select('id') after insert, as UUID is now controlled by the frontend
- Improved frontend/backend separation and security for anonymous submissions
